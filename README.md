# ask-my-course
Ask My Course is a fully open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers questions using course-related data (e.g., Slack messages, transcripts, notes). Built with local tools like Ollama, Qdrant, and Streamlit, it enables interactive, searchable access to your course knowledge â€” with no paid APIs.
